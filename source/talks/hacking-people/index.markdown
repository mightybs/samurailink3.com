# Abstract

Another big social engineering attack just scammed someone out of another Twitter username, and it seems we haven't quite learned our lessons from Mat Honan's earlier case. Why is social engineering still and issue? Haven't we been dealing with this for decades? This talk is about Social Engineering, the high level overview, some quick history, recent hacks, and lessons we can take with us.

# Bio

Tom Webster is an IT grunt, VPN admin, Security Lead, Programmer, and general tech guy at BWI Group. He's constantly breaking, fixing, and researching things as well as ranting over at [SamuraiLink3.com](http://www.samurailink3.com/) and his [Google Plus profile](https://plus.google.com/+TomWebster/about). Tom has a secret love of cooking while wearing Google Glass and can make a damn good pot roast.
