When I'm not slaying dragons or saving orphan kittens from fires, sometimes I like to kick back and give talks on various subjects. Here's a collection of various talks I've given over the years, along with podcast appearances.

# Talks

## [Eject the Warp Core: A Practical Look at Filesystem Segregation and Encryption](/blog/2012/05/10/eject-the-warp-core-a-practical-look-at-filesystem-segregation-and-encryption/) - 2013-05-10

I wanted to hack my CR48 and make it a truly secure box. Secure in the way that an adversary could walk away with the computer, and I'm left holding the truly important data. Welcome to ejectable core computing.

## [Making Security Shiny](/talks/making-security-shiny/) - 2013-10-10

Interfaces suck and security applications are among some of the worst offenders. In this talk, I dive into various security program interfaces, what make them bad (and good, in a few cases), and what lessons we can learn to make them better.
