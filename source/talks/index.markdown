When I'm not slaying dragons or saving orphan kittens from fires, sometimes I like to kick back and give talks on various subjects. Here's a collection of various talks I've given over the years, along with podcast appearances.

# Talks

## [Eject the Warp Core: A Practical Look at Filesystem Segregation and Encryption](/blog/2012/05/10/eject-the-warp-core-a-practical-look-at-filesystem-segregation-and-encryption/) - 2013-05-10

I wanted to hack my CR48 and make it a truly secure box. Secure in the way that an adversary could walk away with the computer, and I'm left holding the truly important data. Welcome to ejectable core computing.

## [Making Security Shiny](/talks/making-security-shiny/) - 2013-10-10

Interfaces suck and security applications are among some of the worst offenders. In this talk, I dive into various security program interfaces, what make them bad (and good, in a few cases), and what lessons we can learn to make them better.

## [Salting your Hashes: Modern Password Storage](/talks/salting-your-hashes/) - 2013-12-12

Just a quick presentation for the Ohio InfoSec Forum holiday meeting.

Writing a web app? Storing user passwords? Don't ever store them in plain text, you already know this. But do you know how to securely hash them? Here's a very basic look at salted hashes and how they improve security.

# Podcast Appearances

## inSecurity

I co-host the [inSecurity](http://insecurityshow.com) podcast with [Chaim Cohen](http://chaimtime.com/) [(+ChaimCohen)](https://plus.google.com/+ChaimCohen). It's a security show for normal people about how to protect yourself online, security devices, news, and more. We record live Wednesday evenings (usually around 8PM) and you can catch our videos and live recordings on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/inSecurityShow). We offer MP3 download on our [website](http://insecurityshow.com) or via our [RSS Feed (part of the inThirty network)](http://feeds.feedburner.com/inThirty).

## inThirty

Sometimes I join the [inThirty](http://inthirty.net/) team to talk about popular security news or tech trends.

### [inThirty 98 – Looking Through the PRISM](http://inthirty.net/2013/06/inthirty-98-looking-through-the-prism/)

In this podcast, I was asked to join in on a discussion about PRISM and what it means for computer users everywhere.

### [inThirty 111 – Encrypted SEO](http://inthirty.net/2013/09/encrypted-seo-inthirty-111/)

Google switched ALL of their search traffic to SSL. Does this really protect anyone from the prying eyes of the NSA? The inThirty gang bring me on to discuss the technical details of the change.
