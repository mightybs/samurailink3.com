This article is in response to the new ASUS eee Pads that are coming out. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/31/asus-eee-pad-ep101tc-and-ep121-hands-on/">Engadget did ran a preview article on them</a> and I would like to share my thoughts on the subject:<br />I really like the idea of a tablet that actually contains any resemblance of functionality. The only problem I have with these and most other non-apple tablets is that they are almost all based off of Windows 7. Now, I don't have a problem with Windows 7, at all. I think it is the best version of Windows ever created, and it takes a lot for me to say that, but you cannot make a true, intuitive, responsive touch-based interface by putting a skin over an existing, built-for-mouse-and-keyboard operating system. Windows 7 with NEVER be a *great* touch operating system, just because that wasn't the main focus when creating the operating system. Sure, Windows 7 has some pretty good touch-centric UI features, but it wasn't built from the ground up to be a touch-only, or touch-first system. Windows 7 was designed, first and foremost, to be operated with a keyboard and mouse. iOS and Android were both built from the ground up to be touch-first (not neccessarily touch-exclusive, however) devices, which automatically puts them head-and-shoulders above any Windows 7 skin. This new ASUS hardware looks absolutely wonderful, but I can't help but imagine how amazing it would be with a software set that was built primarily for this type of device. To summarize all of this: I can't help but feel the inclusion of Windows 7 on this tablet is just as good of a fit as putting square wheels on a car.<br /><br /><b><u>UPDATE:</u><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;It appears that ASUS has&nbsp;announced&nbsp;that they are looking to put <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5591414/asus-wants-android-for-eeepad">Android on the eeePad</a>. A very wise move, indeed.</span></b></div>
