In order to get OctoPress up and running in this tutorial series, you'll need Git installed and configured. Luckily, this is quick and easy.

First, install `git` and `git-core`, chances are, if you've followed this tutorial in order, you probably have these installed already.

Next, We need to tell git who we are with `git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"` and what our email address is with `git config --global user.email "address@example.com"`

With this done, you can create and manage git repositories, very important for our OctoPress install later.
