I've got an amount of time in my day that I'd like to spend ranting, raving, and explaining about various projects I've got on my plate. Only one problem: <span style="font-weight: bold;">I have no idea where to begin</span>. That's why I need you to tell me. What do you want to read about? It could be anything from, "I want to build a media server" to "How to <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">synchronize</span> various folders/disks/<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">filesystems</span> easily" to "I want to make a DOOM server". Anything that's doable and you think I could be pretty apt at explaining. Remember, Linux is a plus, but anything that works across multiple operating systems is great too. I could even cover programs or general "I want to do <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span>..." computer questions. Leave a comment! Go! Its up to you now.<br />I'm just letting you know... we're counting on you.<br /></div></div>
