<div id="m5og" style="padding: 1em 0pt; text-align: center;"><img style="width: 309px; height: 64px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dcbbbrhr_4487jtqj4dm_b" /></div>Haven't posted in a while, but I've been reading about a ton of new tech. While I could go on about the amazing Public Beta of Windows 7 (which I've been using for about three weeks already), or Palm's return to form with the new Pre. I'm going to delve into a website I've been using for years that I think you should give a shot.<br /><br />First off: We don't have time to read. We have jobs, classes, friends, family matters, and reruns of I Love Lucy to attend to on a daily basis. Reading just doesn't top our priority lists, and even if it does, we have to deliberately carve out sections of our day to make it fit. The solution is <a title="DailyLit" href="http://www.dailylit.com/" id="rwez">DailyLit</a>. An amazingly simple idea that allows you to read a book slowly over time through email or RSS. <a title="DailyLit" href="http://www.dailylit.com/" id="m1y1">DailyLit</a> sends you small, easily digestible chunks of books to your inbox, your cell phone, or your favorite RSS program. They even include a link to grab the next chunk instantly if you get really involved in the story.<br /><div id="i8x_" style="padding: 1em 0pt; text-align: center;"><img style="width: 465px; height: 210px;" src="http://docs.google.com/File?id=dcbbbrhr_447dt7t7ggs_b" /></div>Most of the books on <a title="DailyLit" href="http://www.dailylit.com/" id="q38n">DailyLit</a> are public domain or <a title="Creative Commons" href="http://creativecommons.org/" id="vz33">Creative Commons</a> licensed (this means FREE), but there are a few premium books scattered here and there. You won't find the newest books or best sellers here, but if you feel like reading a classic, you're in luck. Next time you're at work, checking emails, browsing <a title="digg.com" href="http://www.digg.com/" id="alvk">digg.com</a>, and genuinely wasting your time, try something new, feel like you're making a slow but steady accomplishment by reading a book on <a title="DailyLit" href="http://www.dailylit.com/" id="jm1w">DailyLit</a>. Check it out, I'm sure you'll like it!<br /><br /><a title="DailyLit.com" href="http://www.dailylit.com/" id="xbuy">DailyLit.com</a><br /><br />By the way: Right now I'm reading <a title="Little Brother" href="http://www.dailylit.com/books/little-brother" id="de:z">Little Brother</a> by <a title="Cory Doctorow" href="http://craphound.com/" id="wp_b">Cory Doctorow</a>, and I'd suggest starting out with <a title="Free Culture" href="http://dailylit.com/books/free-culture" id="p2ww">Free Culture</a> by <a title="Lawrence Lessig" href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/" id="emph">Lawrence Lessig</a>. Its quite the amazing book that takes a detailed look at Copyright and how its essentially broken and useless in this day and age of technology. But that's another post for another day.</div>
