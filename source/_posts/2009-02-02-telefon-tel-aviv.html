I'm no expert and I don't pretend to be, but I do know what's good and what's bad. First off... this isn't a post about me, its a post about one of my favorite bands of all time, <i>Telefon Tel Aviv</i>, and how they can't make music anymore... Telefon Tel Aviv consisted of two main members spouting off hand-tuned electronic/ambient riffs that are just incredible... there's no other way to describe them. Sadly... one member of TTA passed away quite recently, and there's no word on what will happen to the band. Passed away <b>the day after their newest album was released</b>. The man is a badass. Regardless, TTA is fucking awesome and you should give them a listen:<br /><br /><strike>Telefon Tel Aviv - Fahrenheit Fair Enough - Fahrenheit Fair Enough<br /><br />Telefon Tel Aviv - The Map of What is Effortless - When It Happens It Moves All By Itself</strike>  <b><br />Links now defunct.<br /><br /></b></div>
