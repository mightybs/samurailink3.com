You have a computer capable of running Ubuntu Linux 9.10.<br />2. You have a router with the ability to port forward.<br />3. Your internet connection is of Broadband capacity or better.<br />4. You don't want to spend any money, or you want to spend as little as possible.<br /><br />First thing you will need to do is download and burn an Ubuntu 9.10 Alternate Install Disk. [Why the Alternate install disk? I, personally, like to encrypt my server hard drives. This is completely optional, and the 'normal' install disk is faster/easier to install, but this guide will walk through the alternate install disk for encryption purposes.]<br /><br />Go ahead and step through the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samurailink3/4203725161/">"Server-Bits #1"</a> photo set on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> to run through the tutorial.<br /><br /><i>About Server-Bits:</i><br /><h3 class="UIIntentionalStory_Message" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;msg&quot;}" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span class="UIStory_Message">If you've ever wanted to get started building a server, right in your own backyard, kitchen, closet, mother's closet, mother's basement, then this is the read for you.
