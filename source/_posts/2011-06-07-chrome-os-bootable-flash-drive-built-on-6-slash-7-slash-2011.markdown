Another version! Its been quite a while since I've put one of these out, so I figured it would help everyone if I released an updated version. As usual, all instructions are included in the download, so pull it down and give it a shot. Chrome OS is really growing up, and fast. I'm really excited for the future of Chrome OS and cloud-based computing in general. This is the future and it is now.

**Update: Looks like there were a few nasty bugs with the June 7th build, I've rebuilt with newer sources in an attempt to give you a more stable build. Enjoy!**

**Update 2: Looks like the 6/13 build has some major GUI bugs and stability issues. Here's the main point: These are daily builds, nasty bugs happen. I'll wait a bit before releasing the next daily build, see what happens from there. I've re-included the link to the previous version, as it is a bit more stable.**
