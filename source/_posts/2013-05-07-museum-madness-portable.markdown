When I was a kid, I played a _ton_ of the game Museum Madness. An old [MECC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECC) game that was all about learning various subjects, solving cool puzzles, and enjoying the point-and-click adventure world. Unfortunately, the company eventually went under, leaving the game as [Abandonware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware). Getting this old game to run isn't terrible on Windows 7, but unless you know your way around [DosBox](#) or a command line interface, your average user may run into trouble. To fix this problem, I created a [double-click-to-run Museum Madness launcher](https://github.com/samurailink3/MuseumMadnessPortable). All of my code is open source and freely available, the game itself is kind of under a grey-ish abandonware type license, so I'm not entirely sure if you can deconstruct it. I grabbed the game data from [Abandonia.com](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/479/Museum+Madness.html), who host a **TON** of abandoned games, go check it out. In the mean time, here's the game:

[Windows XP/7 x86 and x64](https://github.com/samurailink3/MuseumMadnessPortable/archive/windows.zip) - You can try it on other Window's platforms, I haven't tested it though.

[Linux x64](https://github.com/samurailink3/MuseumMadnessPortable/archive/linux_x64.tar.gz)

Want it ported to a different system? Do it, send me a pull request.
