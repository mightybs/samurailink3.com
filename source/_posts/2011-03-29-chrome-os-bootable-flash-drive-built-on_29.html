Another build, this one a week later. I've heard some reports that the Chrome Web Apps weren't working quite perfectly on some machines, that's the risk when you're running daily-builds of an operating system. This is freshly built as of yesterday, and I've update the instructions to include how to create a bootable Chrome OS flash drive in both Linux and Mac OSX. As usual, the Windows instructions are still there as always. After the jump, I'll include a copy/paste of the Instructions.txt file for your convenience. Have fun and let me know what you think!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><strike>Chrome OS - 032811.7z</strike></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b><a href="http://www.samurailink3.com/2011/08/chrome-os-bootable-flash-drive-built-on.html"><span id="goog_1134218529"></span>New Version H<span id="goog_1134218532"></span><span id="goog_1134218533"></span>ere<span id="goog_1134218530"></span></a></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>Credits and Utilities:<br />To unpack this file, you will need the totally awesome and free unzipping utility: <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a><br />This pack contains the <a href="https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer">Image Writer for Microsoft Windows</a>, which is a great, simple way to take or place images onto drives.

Open the image writer program.<br />2. Click the blue folder, select the usb_chromiumos_image*version info here*.img<br />3. Select the USB drive you would like to make bootable.<br />4. Click the 'Write' Button<br /><br /><br />To install Chromium OS on your main drive:<br /><br />WARNING!<br />DANGER!<br />READ THIS!<br />=====================================<br />THIS WILL WIPE YOUR ENTIRE HARD DRIVE<br />=====================================<br /><br />1. Boot from your USB device.<br />2. CTRL+ALT+F2<br />3. Login as Username: chronos Password: password<br />4. Run '/usr/sbin/chromeos-install'<br /><br />==============================================<br />How to create a bootable drive using OSX/Linux<br />==============================================<br /><br />DISCLAIMER!!<br />Be very very very careful with the dd command. This is a block device writer, it CAN AND WILL DESTROY ALL OF YOUR DATA IF USED INCORRECTLY.<br />CHOOSE THE RIGHT DEVICE TO WRITE TO!!!!<br /><br />1. Open up a terminal<br />2. Use the command 'df'<br />3. At the very right of the table that is shown, you will see your mountpoint.<br />4. Try to recognize where your flash drive is mounted<br />5. For example, my flash drive is mounted at /media/flashdrive, to the left, I see the device as /dev/sdb1 (or on OSX, something like this: /dev/disk2s1)<br />6. You can also use the command like this 'df -h', this will show you the space total/used/free in human-readable values (8GB) instead of byte count, you should be able to recognize your drive on space alone.<br />7. READ THE DISCLAIMER ABOVE THIS SECTION. Be careful. PLEASE! You can and will overwrite your main OS disk (or any other attached device) if you are not 100% sure you have the correct drive. Keep this in mind when using terminal commands.<br />8. Use the command 'dd' to copy the raw image to your flash drive, here is how the command breaks down: dd if=/users/username/pathtoyour/imagefile.img of=/dev/disk2<br />9. Remember, you need to write the image to the full device, not just a partition. So if your 'flash drive' is /dev/sdb1, you want to use '/dev/sdb' in the 'dd' command. Likewise on OSX, if your drive is '/dev/disk2s1' you want to use '/dev/disk2' alone, without the partition modifier.<br />10. Most likely, you will need to use 'sudo' to invoke the dd command, depending on your setup.<br />11. You may need to unmount your flash drive to avoid a 'Resource Busy' error message.<br /><br />These are daily builds, they have not been well tested for quality. Be careful and have fun.
