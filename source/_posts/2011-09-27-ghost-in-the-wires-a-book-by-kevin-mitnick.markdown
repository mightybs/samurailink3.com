Just finished reading a wonderful book by Kevin Mitnick, hacker extraordinaire! As some of you may know, Kevin Mitnick was a fugitive hacker who ran for years and taught us all about social engineering, how to effectively use zero-day exploits, but most of all, how hackers need to target people first, computers second. In this book, Kevin is finally able to write about his firsthand experiences running from the law, compromising administrators and systems, and going into some great technical detail at the same time.
The very first thing you'll notice about this book is that it reads like a spy novel. Twists and turns! Backstabbing! RHosts files! Its all in here.
The book contains technical bits for those who 'get them' (I do! I do!), but the story is completely comprehensible to anyone without any technical experience whatsoever, thanks to Mitnick's brilliant writing style. If you've read any other books concerning this tale, you'll get the other perspective, straight from the source. It isn't a very deep book and should be looked upon as a spy-novel dealing with computer hackers. Its fun, its a ride, its about 400 pages, but it is a popcorn-style book. Have fun and run through this, I enjoyed it.
