I've taken to packaging my own vanilla builds of Chrome OS (Well... **Chromium OS**), and am going to start releasing them semi-regularly. Comes packed with the great **Image Writer for Microsoft Windows** (https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer) and stupid-simple instructions on getting a bootable flash drive made to test drive Chrome OS. Ever since Hexxeh stopped major development (that I've seen, correct me if I'm wrong), I've been listening to people clamor for an easy way to test drive Chrome OS without having to build from the source code up. I want to help those people. Every so often, I will make a build of Chrome OS and post it here to my blog. Enjoy!!
