It has been uncovered that Bing has been poaching Google search results! Here are the cliff notes:<br /><br /><ul><li>Bing will show the spellchecked search results from Google, without fixing the misspelling.</li><li>Bing results have been&nbsp;suspiciously&nbsp;close to Google results for a long time, Google decided to create a sting operation.</li><ul><li>Google created non-sense words and results pages for those made-up jumbles of characters.</li><li>Google tasked engineers to search for these words from home, using Internet Explorer with Suggested Sites enabled and the Bing toolbar installed.</li><li>Soon after, these non-sense search results (Which had NOTHING to do with the term searched for) started popping up on Bing.</li><li>7 out of 9 tests give overwhelming evidence that Bing has been stealing search results from Google.</li></ul></ul><div>So what exactly does this mean for Bing? Microsoft is holding a search event later today (which is why Google could be unveiling this now), and <a href="http://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/32468712502075393">Matt Cutts is on a panel with them later today</a>, so I expect we will hear more then.</div><div><br /></div><div>The original tweet is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/32459370511994880">http://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/32459370511994880</a></div><div><br /></div><div>Check out the very&nbsp;thorough&nbsp;and awesome analysis of the situation by <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-is-cheating-copying-our-search-results-62914">Search Engine Land</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>I think search is going to get very interesting over the next couple of weeks...</div></div>
