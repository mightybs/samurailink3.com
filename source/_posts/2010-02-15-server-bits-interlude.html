<div class='post'>
I really have been working on the next set of posts, really... For two weeks. The next post will include something equally different, but just as important as sheer technical skill: The ability to work with users. Deployment, documentation, dumbing-things-down. If you always count on the super-nerdy to use what you build, you won't go very far, things need to be documented and easy to use. Stay tuned, there is a lot to go through.</div>
