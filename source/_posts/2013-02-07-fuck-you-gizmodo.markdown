I was recently sent a link to a Gizmodo article that left me extremely pissed off, so it's rant time. [Here's the article in question](http://gizmodo.com/5980842/).

Go on, read through it, I'll be here when you get back.

**I know, right!?!?!?** What the fuck, Giz? You are calling [GitHub](https://github.com) racist and sexist for content that 
people post on it? Content that is little more than code comments, directories, and variable/method names.
You may as well start calling YouTube racist for some of the videos it hosts. Hell, may as well say that [Google is operated by Nazis](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hitler%20was%20awesome) 
because of the text it stores in its index. For fuck's sake.... is it _that_ slow of a news day that you have to start attacking everything within arm's reach like 
some god damn tabloid? I mean, lets be honest with ourselves, Gawker is little more than a tabloid with slight tech leanings anyway. But seriously, they aren't even trying anymore. 
This is blatant stupidity. You know... Come to think of it... I think I've seen some racist and/or sexist comments in Giz's comment section... RACIST SEXIST PIGS!
