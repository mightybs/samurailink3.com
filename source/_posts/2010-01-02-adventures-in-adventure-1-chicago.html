We are here in Chicago. We're staying in the <a href="http://www.chicagosouthloophotel.com/">Chicago South Loop Hotel</a>, not the fanciest place around, but it more than serves its purpose as a sleep/shower joint. Right now we're online trying to figure out which pizza options are open to us at this time of night (1:52 AM).<br />New Info:<br /><ul><li>Trains are $2.50 per ride, or $5 for a day pass.</li><li>Some of the reviewers over at <a href="http://hotels.com/">Hotels.com</a> are whiny bastards (The room I'm in is dandy!).</li><li>In-Phone GPS systems <i>HATE</i> Chicago streets.</li><li>I really really really want a cup of shitty diner coffee.</li></ul><div>(2:23 AM) Apparently there is no such thing as authentic Chicago-style pizza past midnight.<br /></div><div>Video of hotel room <b><i>[coming soon]</i></b>:<br /></div><div><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vxbVGw8WBIM&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vxbVGw8WBIM&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /></div></div>
