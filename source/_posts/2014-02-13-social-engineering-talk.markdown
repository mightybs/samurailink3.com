Tonight I'll be giving another talk at [Ohio InfoSec Forum](http://www.ohioinfosec.org/), this time about [Social Engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_\(security\)). I decided to choose a horror-movie theme for my deck (you know, **hacking** people...), and I think it turned out pretty well. Anyway, if you want to check it out, [head over here](/talks/hacking-people/). As always, my slides are a bit thin, so download the zip file and check out the speaker notes.
