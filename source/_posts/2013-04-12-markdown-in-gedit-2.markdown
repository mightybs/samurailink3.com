Because of my latest switch to [OctoPress](http://octopress.org/), I've been writing in [Markdown](#) a lot recently. I use [gedit](#) as my editor of choice because I find it simple enough with just the right amount of features/plugins. Since my recent switch to [Debian](http://www.debian.org), I've moved to older, more stable versions of my applications, and I needed a way to get Markdown support into gedit 2.30.

[This post](http://www.jpfleury.net/en/software/gedit-markdown.php) over at [Jean-Philippe Fleury](http://www.jpfleury.net/) makes everything incredibly easy. Head over that way for the full instructions:
