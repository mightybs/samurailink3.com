**And soon!**

I just went to add 'Freelance Tech Guy' to my list of employers on my Google+ profile, and I was surprised to find that Google not only lists potential business, but lists their pictures/logos as well. Is this part of the brand rollout we've been hearing so much about? It seems rather apparent to me that brands and companies will be added soon.

_Again, I have no insider information on this, just a guess based on my experience with this unannounced 'feature'._


**Edit:** Also, notice how some 'non-companies' will show up in this list, things like Pokemon show up in the list if you try it out. In the next screenshot, I search for 'mario', and 'Nintendo' pops up in the list. Check the screenshot for a peak.
