Lets start with a quote from the <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">original article</a>: <br /><blockquote>"Adobe's Flash products are 100% proprietary. They are only available from Adobe, and Adobe has sole authority as to their future enhancement, pricing, etc. While Adobe’s Flash products are widely available, this does not mean they are open, since they are controlled entirely by Adobe and available only from Adobe. By almost any definition, Flash is a closed system."</blockquote>Lets make some quick changes to this...<br /><blockquote>&nbsp;"<strike>Adobe's Flash</strike> <i>Apple</i> products are 100% proprietary. They are only available from <strike>Adobe</strike> <i>Apple</i>, and <strike>Adobe</strike> <i>Apple</i> has sole authority as to their future enhancement, pricing, etc. While <strike>Adobe’s Flash</strike> <i>Apple's</i> products are widely available, this does not mean they are open, since they are controlled entirely by <strike>Adobe</strike> <i>Apple</i> and available only from <strike>Adobe</strike> <i>Apple</i>.
