Just a cool tip I found to hide the user list on the logon screen. I have a great number of users, and the list was getting pretty ridiculous... <i>This command will restart your xserver. Save your work beforehand.</i><br /><blockquote><b>sudo gconftool-2 --direct --config-source  xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory --type Boolean --set  /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list True<br /><br />sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart</b></blockquote><br /><br />And that will give you a nice clean username/password box.<br /><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/goog_1815785878"><br /></a><br /><a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-remove-hide-users-list-at-login-screen-in-ubuntu-9-10-karmic.html">Via: Ubuntu Geek: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-remove-hide-users-list-at-login-screen-in-ubuntu-9-10-karmic.html</a><br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><i>About Server-Bits:</i><br /><br /><br />If you've ever wanted to get started building a server, right in your  own backyard, kitchen, closet, mother's closet, mother's basement, then  this is the read for you.
